# ORBITCODE
code for the space debris collision avoidance system 
A spacecraft follows a predefined trajectory in the space during its mission to fulfill its objective. Due to the presence of space debris which are naturally occurring in space like planetary remains, space rocks etc. or man made like satellite debris , the spacecraft always remains at risk of collision with these debris. To prevent such kind of collision and loss of the spacecraft and human lives , a collision avoidance system is designed. The system functions on the basis of tracking the space debris field and finding an alternative route. With the help of image processing , the debris field can be tracked down and by Voronoi’s diagram which In mathematics, is a partitioning of a plane into regions based on distance to points in a specific subset of the plane. That set of points is specified beforehand, and for each seed there is a corresponding region consisting of all points closer to that seed than to any other,  and Dijkstra’s algorithm or (Dijkstra's Shortest Path First algorithm, SPF algorithm) is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph , an alternate trajectory can be decided. The required thrusts and maneuvers will be fed to the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) and Reaction Control system (RMS) to control the spacecraft orientation and trajectory.
